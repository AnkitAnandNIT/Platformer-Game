# Platformer-Game
This folder contains my original source code for a Platformer game along with all assets. 

You need Python 3 and PyGame to run this on your system. With these installed, just open 'main.py' file in Platformer folder in a code editor and and run it to play the game.

This game have basic platformer actions like jumping, running, moving platforms, enemies, lava, coins and a lot more.
Currently, it has 5 different levels with increasing difficulty.
Hope you enjoy it!
