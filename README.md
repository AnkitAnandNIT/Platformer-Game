# Platformer-Game
This folder contains my original source code for a Platformer game along with all assets. 

You need to download "Platformer.rar". Extract the file and select main.exe and run it to play the game.

This game have basic platformer actions like jumping, running, moving platforms, enemies, lava, coins and a lot more.
Currently, it has 5 different levels with increasing difficulty.

Hope you enjoy it!
